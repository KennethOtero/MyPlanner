# My Planner Project

Purpose:

This is a personal project of mine that allows users to keep track of their schoolwork. I wanted to create this mainly for myself as a way to stay on top of my homework. I wanted to do my own take on this concept and do it in the purest way possible, without any of the fluff other apps provide. My Planner utilizes the skillset I learned while pursuing my Associates degree and also some tech I learned while creating this project. The project utilizes AJAX to interact with my database without refreshing the page, allowing for a better user experience. My Planner doesn't utilize any frameworks (at the moment) and was created in pure JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, CSS, and HTML. Currently I run this site locally, so there aren't any plans to host it yet. If the site gets more advanced, I may consider hosting.

Functionality:

Users can create and edit their accounts. Upon account creation, users have to choose their starting semester (Spring, Summer, Fall) along with the year. After doing so, users can create their courses and create assignments for said courses. On the homepage, users can see all of their unfinished assignments, and on the tasks page edit those assignments to show completion, edit their contents, as well as create/edit more assignments, courses, or semesters. The schedule page shows all of the user's classes throughout the week (Mon-Fri) for the current semester. If a day has more than one class, those classes are ordered by their start time. My Planner is also made to accomodate different screen sizes, utilizing a hamburger style menu on smaller screens.
