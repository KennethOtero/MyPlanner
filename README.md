# MyPlanner
This is a personal project of mine that allows users to keep track of their schoolwork. Users can create and edit their accounts. Upon account creation, users have to choose their starting semester (Spring, Summer, Fall) along with the year. After doing so, users can create their courses and create assignments for said courses. On the homepage, users can see all of their unfinished assignments, and on the tasks page edit those assignments to show completion, edit their contents, as well as create more assignments, courses, or semesters.

This project was made to fill my own need to track my assignments in the easiest way possible, and demonstrate the skills that I've learned both in and out of school. The project utilizes AJAX to interact with my database without refreshing the page, allowing for a better user experience. This project was created in pure JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, CSS, and HTML. There may be updates in the future, but for now it stands as a completed project.
